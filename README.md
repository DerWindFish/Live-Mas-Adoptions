Have you ever wondered what a pet adoption agency run by the geniuses at Taco Bell would be like? Well wonder no more.

Welcome to the Live Más adoption agency! A whole new way to experience adopting a fuzzy new friend!

In this project I plan to build a pet adoption site themed after Taco Bell, where user will be able to view pictures of various pets named after taco bell menu items, click on the pictures to be taken to a page where you can view information about the animal (breed, age, personalilty). I also plan on having the ability to add, edit and delete pets from the system. I will also have a page where you can put in your information to volunteer at the agency.
