Have you ever wondered what a pet adoption agency run by the geniuses at Taco Bell would be like? Well wonder no more.

Welcome to the Live Más adoption agency! A whole new way to experience adopting a fuzzy new friend!

In this project I built a pet adoption site themed after Taco Bell, where user will be able to view pictures, and learn information about various pets all of whom are named after taco bell menu items. You are also able view a list of all the Voulnteers at the agency, as well at add, delete and edit information from that list.
